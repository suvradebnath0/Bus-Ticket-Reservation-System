The Bus Ticket Reservation System presented several features designed to 
facilitate bus booking and management. Here are the key features of the system:
• Interface: The main functionality is organized into a interface, allowing 
users to navigate through different options such as viewing bus lists, 
booking tickets, canceling bookings, checking bus status, and exiting the 
system.
• Bus List Display: Users can view a list of available buses, each identified by 
a unique number. The system displays the names of different buses, such as 
"ENA Express," "HANIF Express," etc.
• User Authentication: The system includes a basic login mechanism requiring 
users to enter a predefined username ("user") and password ("pass") to 
access the main functionalities. This adds a level of security to the system.
• Ticket Booking: Users can select a bus from the list and book tickets by 
specifying the desired number of seats. The system updates the seat 
availability and stores passenger details, including names and seat numbers, 
in files.
• Ticket Cancellation: Booked tickets can be canceled by entering the bus 
number and the seat number to be canceled. The system refunds the booking 
amount, updates seat availability, and removes the passenger details.
• Bus Status Display: Users can check the current status of booked and 
available seats for a specific bus. The information is presented in a tabular 
format, showing seat numbers and corresponding passenger names.
